# ClipboardManager plugin for AutoCAD (Mac)

## Sample ObjectARX for Mac project

---

### Summary
In an attempt to get back up to speed with AutoCAD's ObjectARX API, I thought it would be a fun experience to port the plugin of the month from last year "ClipboardManager" to AutoCAD for Mac.

**Still a work in progress...**
